Novoalign V3.04.06

Usage:
    novoalign options

Options:
    -d dbname      Full pathname of indexed reference sequence from novoindex
    --alt          Enables GRC38 alt contig MAPQ calculation mode.
    --mmapOff      Turns off memory mapping for the index. By default the index
                   file is memory mapped allowing it to be shared by multiple
                   instances of Novoalign.
    --hugePage     Will attempt to load index into huge pages. If this fails then acts like --mmapOff.
    --LockIdx      Use MAP_LOCKED flag when memory mapping the index.
    --NonC         When used there is no guarantee of concordance between reruns of same data & options.

Options for Read processing:
    -f read1 read2     Filenames for the read sequences for Side 1 & 2.
                   If only one file is specified then single end reads are processed.
                   If two files are specified then the program will operate in paired end mode.
    -# 999[K|M|%]  Process a subsample of reads.
    -# 9:99
                    Examples...
                     -# 10K       Stop after processing 10,000 reads.
                     -# 1%        Only process every 100th read.
                     -# 0.5% -#1K Only process every 200th read and stop after 1000.
                     -# 1:10      Skip 1 read and then process every 10th read. (Requires a license.)
                     Note. The -# 99% format is redundant and will be removed in a future release.
    --hdrhd [9|off] Controls checking of identity between headers in paired end reads. 
                   Sets the Hamming Distance or disables the check. Default is a Hamming Distance of not 
                   more than 1. Processing will stop with appropriate error messages if 
                   Hamming Distance exceeds the limit.
    -F format      Specifies a read file format, refer to manual for full list of options.
                   For Fastq '_sequence.txt' files from Illumina
                       CASAVA 1.3 to 1.7 use -F ILMFQ.
                       CASAVA 1.8 and later use -F ILM1.8
                       Pre 1.3 use -F SLXFQ
                       Sanger standard use -F STDFQ
                   QSEQ & ILM1.8 files include reads that have been flagged as low quality by the
                   base caller. Specify how these are processed with the following options:
    --ILQ_USE      Ignore QC flag and align the reads.
    --ILQ_SKIP     Skip the reads entirely (Default). They will not appear in the reports.
    --ILQ_QC       Do not align reads but include in report with QC flag.
    -H [t [m]]     Hard clip trailing bases with quality <= t using modified Mott's algorithm.
                   t defaults to 2 and m to 30. Refer to manual for more details.
    --trim3HP      Hard clip 3' homopolymers regardless of base quality. Min length 15bp and 
                   88% pure. Useful for reads that degrade to high quality homopolymer sequences.
                   Applied after -H if used.
    --Q2Off        Turns off treating Q=2 bases as 'Illumina Read Segment Quality Control Indicator'
    --amplicons <bedfile> [delta] [output BED file]
                   Turns on soft clipping of primer bases for reads that align to amplicons.
                   The optional 'delta' field is the number of bp deviation allowed between 
                   alignment location and the primer location. Default 0. Range 0-9
                   You can also add a filename for an output BED file after the delta option.
                   The score column of the bedfile is the number of reads/pairs that matched 
                   the amplicon.
    -l 99          Sets the minimum information content for a read in base pairs. Default log4(Ng) + 5
                   where Ng is the length of the reference genome. Measure uses base qualities
                   to determine information content of the read in bits and divides by 2 to get
                   effective length in bases.
    -n 99          Truncate reads to the specified length before alignment. Default is 950, maximum is 950.
    -p 99,99 [0.9,99]
                   Sets polyclonal filter thresholds.  The first pair of values (n,t) sets
                   the number of bases and threshold for the first 20 base pairs of each read.
                   If there are n or more bases with phred quality below t then the read is
                   flagged as polyclonal and will not be aligned. The alignment status is 'QC'.
                   The second pair of values applies to the entire read rather than just the first 20bp 
                   and is entered as fraction of bases in the read below the threshold.
                   Setting -p -1 disables the filter. Default -p -1,10 -1.00,10
    -a [read1 adapter] [read2 adapter]
                   Enables adapter stripping from 3' end of reads before aligning. The second
                   adapter is used for the second read in paired end mode.
                   Default adapter sequence for single end is TCGTATGCCGTCTTCTGCTTG.
                   Default adapter sequences for paired end reads are:
                           Read1: AGATCGGAAGAGCGGTTCAGCAGGAATGCCGAG
                           Read2: AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGTA
    -h 99 [99]     Sets homopolymer and optional dinucleotide filter score. Any read that
                   matches a homopolymer or dinuc with score less than or equal to this
                   threshold will be skipped (reported as QC).
                   Default 60 for homopolymer and 20 for dinucleotides.
                   Bi-Seq default 120 for homopolymer and 20 for dinucleotides.
    --hlimit 99    Enables alignment score limit factor for reads that are primarily a 
                   homopolymer sequence. Please refer to manual for more details.
    -5 sequence    Strips primer sequences from 5' end of reads before aligning.
                   Default is not to strip 5' primers.

Options for alignment scoring:
    -t 99          Sets the maximum alignment score acceptable for the best alignment.
    -t a,b         Alignment score threshold is set based on read length L (sum of pairs)
                   using formula (L-a)*b. 
                   Where a is an integer, typically 20, and b is a float typically in range 3 to 5.
                   b should not be greater than the gap extend penalty.
                   Default Automatic. In automatic mode the threshold is set based on read 
                   length, genome size and other factors (see manual).
                   For pairs the threshold includes any fragment penalty and alignment score
                   for both reads.
    -g 99          Sets the gap opening penalty. Default 40
    -x 99          Sets the gap extend penalty. Default 6
    --matchreward 9  Sets a match reward. Typically set to about half the gap extend penalty. Default 0
    -u 99          Penalty for unconverted CHG or CHH cytosine in bisulfite alignment mode. Default 0
                   For plants 6 may be a good value.
    -b mode        Sets Bisulphite alignment mode. Values for mode are:
                        4 - Aligns in 4 possible combinations of direction and index. (Default)
                        2 - Aligns reads in forward direction using CT index and in reverse 
                   complement using the GA index.
    --WCBoth       If a Bi-Seq read maps to both Watson & Crick strands at the same location,
                   same score, and same read orientation then Novoalign default behaviour is 
                   to report the alignment against only one strand chosen at random. This 
                   option turns off the random selection so that two alignments will be reported,
                   one for each strand.
    -N 999         Sets the number of bp of source DNA that are not represented in the reference
                   sequences (index). This value is used in calculation of prior probability that
                   the read originated in sequence that we cannot align to because it is not in
                   the reference sequence set. By default we use the number of bases coded as N's
                   in the reference genome. Set to zero to disable inclusion of this in quality 
                   calculations.

Options for reporting:
    -o format [readgroup]
                   Specifies the report format. Native, Pairwise, SAM. Default is Native. 
                   Optionally followed by SAM @RG record.
                   Refer to manual for details additional options.
    -o Softclip    Turns on soft clipping of alignments. Default for SAM report format.
                   Sets soft clipping penalty to 0.
    --softclip penalty
                   Turns on soft clipping with the given penalty. Extends alignment to the 
                   end of a read if the alignment to the end of read scores better than the
                   best local alignment score less this penalty. A value of 40 is equivalent
                   to bwa mem soft clipping default.
    -o FullNW      Turns off soft clipping of alignments. Default for Pairwise and Native
                   report formats. Sets soft clipping penalty to 99999.
    -o Header text     Appends 'text' to ever read header in the output report.
    -o IUBMatch    In Native report format a match between query and an IUB ambiguous code in
                   the reference will be reported in the list of mismatched bases.
    --rOQ          If quality calibration is on then write original base qualities as SAM OQ:Z: tag
    --rNMOri       If a read is unmapped report read sequence and original qualities before
                   any hard clipping or quality calibration.
    -o Sync        In multi-threaded mode this option ensures output report is synchronous with
                   the read files. This may increase memory utilisation. This option is ineffective
                   in MPI versions.
    -R 99          Sets score difference between best and second best alignment for calling multiple
                   mappings. Default 5.
    -r strategy [limit]
                   Sets strategy for reporting repeats. 'None', 'Random', 'All', 'Exhaustive'
                   Default None.
                   For -r Ex you need to specify a limit on the maximum alignments reported per read.
    -e 999         Sets a limit on number of alignments for a single read.
                   This limit applies to the number of alignments with score equal to that of the best
                   alignment. Alignment process will stop when the limit is reached.
                   Default 1000 in default report mode, off for other modes.
    -q 9           Sets number of decimal places for quality score in Native report format. Default zero.                     In SAM mode adds tag ZQ:f:99.999
    --3Prime       Report mapping location of 3' end of read. In SAM report format this is Z3
                   tag. In Native report format it is attribute immediately after 5' mapping
                   location.
    -K [file]      Collects mismatch statistics for quality calibration by position in the read 
                   and called base quality. Mismatch counts are written to the named file after 
                   all reads are processed. When used with -k option the mismatch counts include 
                   any read from the input quality calibration file.
    --tags taglist Where tag list is a list of SAM tags to be enabled or disabled.
                     --tags MD-    Disables the MD tag.
                     --tags ALL- MD ZS  Disables all tags except MD & ZS.
    -C             Append FASTA/Q comment to SAM output. This option can be used to transfer read
                   meta information (e.g. a barcode) to the SAM output. Note that the FASTA/Q comment
                   (the string after a space in the header line) must conform to the SAM specification
                   for tags (e.g. BC:Z:CGTAC). Malformed comments lead to incorrect SAM output.

Paired End Options:
    -i [mode] 99[-|,]99
    -i MP 99[-|,]99 99[-|,]99
                   Sets approximate fragment length and standard deviation (comma separator) or 
                   a range of fragment lengths (hyphen separator).
                   Mode is:  'PE', '+-', or not specified for paired end reads
                             'MP' or '-+' for Illumina mate pairs.
                   For Illumina mate pairs you can also specify the secondary
                   fragmentation length and standard deviation.
                   The mode changes the expected orientation of the reads in a proper pair.
                   Default -i PE 250,150
                   Note. The -i option sets the expected length of DNA fragment based on outer
                   alignment coordinates. It is not the gap between the two alignments. Other
                   systems may refer to this as Template Length or Insert Size.
    -v 99          Sets the structural variation penalty for chimeric fragments. Default 70
    -v 99 99       Sets the structural variation penalty for chimeric fragments.
                    1) Penalty for SVs within one sequence
                    2) Penalty for SVs across different sequences.
    -v 99 99 99 regex
                   Sets the structural variation penalty for chimeric fragments. The three values are for:
                    1) Penalty for SVs within a group of sequences as defined by the regular expression.
                    2) Penalty for SVs within a single sequence
                    3) Penalty for SVs different sequence and group.
                   regex defines a regular expression applied to headers of indexed sequences. The regular
                   expression should extract one field that is used to define sequence groups.

Single End Options:
    -s 9           Turns on read trimming and sets trimming step size. Default step size is 2bp.
                   Unaligned reads are trimmed until they align or fail the QC tests.
    -m [99]        Sets miRNA mode. In this mode each alignment to a read is given an additional
                   score based on nearby alignment to the opposite strand of the read. Optional
                   parameter sets maximum distance in bp between alignment and it's reverse complement.
                   Default 50bp except in miRNA mode where the default is 'All'.

Base Quality Calibration Options:
    -k [infile] Enables quality calibration. The quality calibration data are either read from 
                the named file or accumulated from actual alignments. Quality calibration does 
                not work with reads in Solexa prb format. Default is no Calibration.
    -K [file]   Collects mismatch statistics for quality calibration by position in the read 
                and called base quality. Mismatch counts are written to the named file after 
                all reads are processed. When used with -k option the mismatch counts include 
                any from the input quality calibration file (-k [infile] option).

Homopolymer Run Length Statistics Option:
    --hpstats [file]   Collects indel statistics by position in the read and XY coordinate. 
                Counts are written to the named file after all reads are processed. 
                Default filename is indels.tsv
                Charts can be plotted using:
                    IONTorrent.R -f indels.tsv -r indels.pdf

Performance Options:
    -c 99          Sets maximum number of threads to use. Defaults to one thread per CPU.
                   Note. Use of hyper-threading may increase the number of available 
                   CPUs and hence threads, but will not necessarily improve performance.
    -S 99          Limits the maximum number of seeds per alignment. If the alignment
                   process reaches this limit then iterative search process is terminated
                   and the best alignment found so far is reported. Set to zero to disable.
                   Default 0.
